## ECDSA Node

Week 1 project from Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp.

Example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. This project uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.
 
### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `nodemon index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!
